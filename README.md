# TextPreprocessing-for-Neural-Network
### This is a simple implementation of text preprocessing, including text2sequence, padding, and embedding matrix construction.

The reason why I create this is that the existted preprocessing function is not very convenient to use. Also, just want to make things easier. If there is any problem or bugs or suggestions, plz feel free to contact me.
