# TextPreprocessing-for-Neural-Network
### This is a simple implementation of text preprocessing, including text2sequence, padding, and embedding matrix construction.

Only for python2. If you want to use in python3, there are several encoding issues to be fixed.

The reason why I create this is that the existed preprocessing function is not very convenient to use. Also, just want to make things easier. If there are any problem or bugs or suggestions, plz feel free to contact me.
